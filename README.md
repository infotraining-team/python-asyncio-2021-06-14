## Environment

The training is based on the latest release of Python - 3.9

A sufficient environment is provided by the official Python website. In the Downloads section, select "Latest Python 3 Release" for the appropriate operating system.

If you are using Linux, you can install Python via the package manager. For Ubuntu, make sure you install version 3.9, by adding an additional repository.

```
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.9
```

If you are using Mac OS X, you can use Homebrew, then install it with:

```
$ brew install python
```
